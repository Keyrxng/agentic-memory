/**
 * GraphRAG Agentic Memory System Demo
 * 
 * This demonstrates the sophisticated fully local agentic memory system
 * built following the latest GraphRAG research and breakthroughs.
 * 
 * The system implements:
 * - In-memory graph data structures with adjacency lists (O(n + m) memory)
 * - Dependency-based entity extraction (94% of LLM performance, more scalable)
 * - Multi-algorithm entity resolution with fuzzy matching
 * - Temporal knowledge management with edge invalidation
 * - BFS/DFS graph traversal for relationship expansion
 * - Memory-bounded processing with LRU eviction
 * - 12-factor agent principles with stateless operations
 * 
 * This is a research and learning project showcasing modern GraphRAG techniques.
