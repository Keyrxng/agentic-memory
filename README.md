# Agentic Memory: A Research Project in GraphRAG Systems (wip)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Research Project Notice**: This is an experimental research project exploring cutting-edge GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques. It implements recent academic discoveries and should be considered a learning/research tool rather than production software.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Notice**: Initial research and data is gathered through the consumption of AI talks, workshops, events etc, specifically AI Engineer World's Fair, and is then expanded upon through Perplexity Labs. It is then put to code by both me and my trusty ghoul man servant, Argyle.

## Overview

Agentic Memory is a TypeScript-based research implementation of advanced graph-based memory systems for agentic AI. This project explores the intersection of knowledge graphs, temporal reasoning, and agentic AI systems, implementing techniques from recent research papers and academic breakthroughs.

The system demonstrates sophisticated memory management capabilities including:
- **In-memory graph data structures** with optimized adjacency list representations
- **Dependency-based entity extraction** achieving 94% of LLM performance with better scalability
- **Multi-algorithm entity resolution** combining deterministic and probabilistic matching
- **Temporal knowledge management** with edge invalidation patterns
- **Memory-bounded processing** using LRU eviction strategies
- **12-factor agent principles** for stateless, scalable operations

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or Bun runtime
- TypeScript 5.0+

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentic-memory.git
cd agentic-memory

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or with Bun
bun install

# Build the project
npm run build
# or
bun run build
```

### Running the Demo
```bash
# Start the interactive demo
bun run dev

# Or run the standalone demo
bun run index.ts
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system is built around several core components:

### Core Graph Engine
- **InMemoryGraph**: Optimized adjacency list implementation for sparse knowledge graphs
- **TemporalGraph**: Extends graph with temporal validity tracking
- **GraphTraversal**: BFS/DFS algorithms for relationship expansion

### Entity Processing
- **DependencyBasedExtractor**: NLP-based entity extraction without LLM dependencies
- **EntityResolver**: Multi-algorithm duplicate detection and resolution
- **ClusteringEngine**: Semantic clustering for related entities

### Memory Management
- **MemoryManager**: LRU eviction and memory bounds enforcement
- **IndexManager**: Multi-modal indexing for fast query processing
- **QueryProcessor**: Natural language to graph query translation

## üìö Key Research Implementations

This project implements several cutting-edge research findings:

### 1. Adjacency List Optimization
Research shows adjacency lists are optimal for sparse knowledge graphs (density < 1.56%), providing O(n + m) memory complexity vs O(n¬≤) for matrices. This project implements the memory breakpoint analysis from recent graph optimization research.

### 2. Dependency-Based Entity Extraction
Implements findings that dependency-based approaches achieve 94% of LLM performance while being significantly more scalable. Uses industrial-grade NLP libraries for entity extraction without requiring external API calls.

### 3. Temporal Knowledge Management
Based on Zep's temporal architecture research, implementing edge invalidation patterns that track when relationships become invalid rather than just creation time.

### 4. Multi-Algorithm Entity Resolution
Combines deterministic exact matching with probabilistic fuzzy matching using Fellegi-Sunter models and embedding-based similarity for robust entity resolution.

## üß™ Examples & Usage

### Basic Memory Operations
```typescript
import { AgentGraphMemory } from './src/agent/memory.js';

const memory = new AgentGraphMemory({
  graph: { maxNodes: 1000, maxEdgesPerNode: 50 },
  extraction: { entityConfidenceThreshold: 0.7 },
  memory: { maxMemoryNodes: 500, evictionStrategy: 'lru' }
});

// Add knowledge to memory
await memory.addMemory(
  "John Smith is a Senior Software Engineer at TechCorp specializing in TypeScript",
  { userId: 'user1', sessionId: 'session1', timestamp: new Date() }
);

// Query memory intelligently
const result = await memory.queryMemory(
  "What does John Smith work on?",
  { userId: 'user1', sessionId: 'session1', timestamp: new Date() }
);
```

### Advanced Clustering
```typescript
// Configure clustering for semantic grouping
const clusteringConfig = {
  similarityThreshold: 0.8,
  maxClusterSize: 20,
  algorithm: 'hierarchical'
};

// Process entities with clustering
const clusters = await memory.clusterEntities(entities, clusteringConfig);
```
